Dear cipherpunks. The purpose of this project **IS TO RUN CODE ON YOUR MACHINE**. Do not report code injection vulnerabilities, mr.smart-pants. In any case, here are some recommendations for the safe execution of Reckoning:

- Reckoning is designed for researchers using their personal computers. **DO NOT RUN** in a corporate environment.
- There are no protection mechanisms since the purpose is not for the project to be exposed or accessible on your network. **RUN ONLY ON LOCALHOST**.
- By the sacred blood of whatever God you believe in, do not report code injection vulnerabilities. :)
