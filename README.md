Reckoning is an mayhem offensive operations orchestrator. Think of it as your personal fixer for cyber ops - connecting tools, passing data, and keeping everything running while you sip synth-coffee.


### The Vibe:
- **Modular AF**: Chain any CLI tool like you're building a custom cyberdeck, including random scripts that I know you use.
- **Smart Ass Data Flow**: You decide whether the input of one tool will be the output of another.
- **Dark Mode Default**: Because we're not animals.
- **Buzzwords for sararymans**: Want to cram AI into something? Go ahead.


### Grab Your Guns:
- **Any Tool, Any Command**: Point it at your binaries, scripts, or that custom tool you wrote at 3 AM, you lifeless junkie.
- **Multiple Input Methods**: Arguments, stdin, files - whatever your tool craves.
- **Output Capture**: Grab stdout, stderr, or file outputs.

### Build Your Ops:
- **Sequential Execution**: Tools run in your specified order, no manual babysitting.
- **Import/Export**: Share your configs with your fellow gentlemen.
- **Auto-Updates**: Keep your tools sharp with built-in update commands.
