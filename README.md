Reckoning is an mayhem offensive operations orchestrator. Think of it as your personal fixer for cyber ops - connecting tools, passing data, and keeping everything running while you sip synth-coffee. Hear me out: this project will execute commands on your computer. Do I need to tell you anything else about the precautions you need to take?


### The Vibe:
- **Modular AF**: Chain any CLI tool like you're building a custom cyberdeck, including random scripts that I know you use.
- **Smart Ass Data Flow**: You decide whether the input of one tool will be the output of another.
- **Buzzwords for sararimans**: Want to cram AI into something? Go ahead.


### Grab Your Guns:
- **Any Tool, Any Command**: Point it at your binaries, scripts, or that custom tool you wrote at 3 AM, you lifeless junkie.
- **Multiple Input Methods**: Arguments, stdin, files - whatever your tool craves.
- **Output Capture**: Grab stdout, stderr, or file outputs.

### Build Your Ops:
- **Sequential Execution**: Tools run in your specified order, no manual babysitting.
- **Import/Export**: Share your configs with your fellow gentlemen.
- **Auto-Updates**: Keep your tools sharp with built-in update commands.

## tl;dr

1. **Clone this repo** - `git clone https://github.com/rf-peixoto/reckoning`
2. **Install** - `install.sh`
3. **Start** - `start.sh`
4. **Point your browser** - `http://localhost:5000`
5. **Build your first workflow** - In an ORGANIZED way, you worm-head.
6. **Execute** - Pick a target and watch the magic happen.
